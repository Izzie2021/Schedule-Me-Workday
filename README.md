# Work Day Scheduler Challenge
This project makes me create an everyday work day scheduler that can provide a daily routine and schedule calendar with days and hours of the day.  The goal of this project is to create an app that can edit and input schedule routines and make sure it displays a quality online work day scheduler using best practices for css, html, jquery, and javascript. 

## User Story
> AS AN employee with a busy schedule\
> I WANT to add important events to a daily planner\
> SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria
> GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule\
> WHEN I open the planner\
> THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar\
> WHEN I scroll down\
> THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours\
> WHEN I view the time blocks for that day\
> THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future\
> WHEN I click into a time block\
> THEN I can enter an event\
> WHEN I click the save button for that time block\
